Zot Point Average:
UCI WebSOC + Grade Distribution Viewer Integration

Version 0.1 (WIP)

You should turn on the extension, and open up UCI's Schedule of Classes webpage. From there, after narrowing down the search you can click on a professor's name and a modal should appear with their grade distribution alongside average GPA teaching that course. Some things to keep in mind is that there are no pre-Covid or post-Covid selections (as teaching styles and online sections may create variation within grade distribution). Additionally, if the grade distribution appears to be blank it can mean that there is no data regarding that professor in the database.
