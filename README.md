UCI WebSOC + Grade Distribution Viewer Integration

Version 0.1 WIP

You should turn on the extension, and open up to UCI's Schedule of Classes. From there, you can click on the professor's username and then be able to view their overall grade distribution and average GPA from their entire lifetime.
